## Summary

<2–4 sentences. What is being built and why this exec plan exists. The full *why* lives in the spec; this file is about the *how*.>

## Research

<Files, modules, and existing patterns the work touches. Cite paths.>

## Approach

<The chosen design. Include the reason it was chosen over the obvious alternative.>

### Files to change

- `path/to/file` — what changes
- `path/to/other` — what changes

### New files

- `path/to/new` — purpose

### Tests

- <named test functions or files that will be added/changed>

## Verification

<Exact runnable commands that prove the change works end to end — the build, lint, and test commands from `AGENTS.md` plus anything specific to this change. Not "run the tests". `/feature-plan-handoff` refuses a plan whose commands are missing or vague.>

```bash
<command>
```

## Open questions

<Anything that needs human judgment before this plan can land. Empty when complete.>

## PR convergence ledger

<Append-only. One entry per `/review-loop` iteration so a fresh harness run can pick up where the previous one left off without rereading PR comments. Keep entries one line each.>

- **<date> iter <N>** — verdict: <APPROVE|COMMENT|REQUEST_CHANGES>; mergeable: <MERGEABLE|CONFLICTING|UNKNOWN>; findings_hash: <hex|empty>; action: <stop|autofix+push|autofix+push (conflict)|escalated:<reason>>; head_sha: <short-sha>.

## Gate verdict

<Filled by `/merge-gate` before the PR merges. Append-only; one entry per gate run. Stage advances to DONE only when the latest entry is PASS.>

- **<date>** — verdict: <PASS|FAIL|NEEDS_FOLLOWUP>; checks: <bullet summary>; followups: <issue numbers or "none">; one-line: <summary>.
