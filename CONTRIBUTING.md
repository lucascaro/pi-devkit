## Feature Workflow

This project uses the [hivesmith](https://github.com/lucascaro/hivesmith) feature pipeline. From inside your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Factory):

1. `/hs-feature-next` — see the current pipeline state and next recommended action
2. `/hs-feature-new <description>` or `/hs-feature-ingest <issue#>` — add a new item
3. `/hs-feature-triage [#]` → `/hs-feature-research [#]` → `/hs-feature-plan [#]` → `/hs-feature-implement [#]`
4. `/hs-changelog-update` — scaffold a `.changesets/<NNN>-<slug>.md` for any user-visible change
5. `/hs-review-pr <#>` — deep parallel review before merge
6. `/hs-release <version>` — cut a release once at least one changeset is present

Specs live under `docs/product-specs/<NNN>-<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter (`stage:` is the source of truth). Exec plans live under `docs/exec-plans/{active,completed}/`. Per-PR changelog entries live under `.changesets/`; `CHANGELOG.md` itself is **generated** on push to `main` by `scripts/regen-generated.sh` — never edit it directly. `docs/product-specs/index.md` and `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` are generated the same way.

## Commit Style

<Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `release:`. Link issues with `Fixes #<number>`.>

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Build, lint, and tests pass (see `AGENTS.md`)
- [ ] `.changesets/<NNN>-<slug>.md` added if user-visible (use `/hs-changelog-update`); use the `no-changeset` PR label for docs- or CI-only changes
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` updated if module map or conventions changed
- [ ] Relevant docs updated (`README.md`, `docs/`)
- [ ] PR description references the issue (`Fixes #<number>`)
